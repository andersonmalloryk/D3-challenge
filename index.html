          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Income and Obesity and Health Care</h2>
          <p>This graph vizualizes state data to show the diffrence between income and obesity or income and health care. 
            The call-outs include both datasets so you can refrence the obesity rate or the health care coverage of the state.
            How much does money matter?
          </p>
          <h3>Income versus Obesity</h3>
          <p>This graph shows that the states with a higher average income do tend to have less obese residents.
            The poorest states have the highest obesity rates, which could also correlate with higher levels of stress and poorer access to healthy food. 
          </p>
          <h3>Income versus Lack of Health Care</h3>
          <p>This graph shows that there is not a likely correlation between average income and the state's health care coverage. 
            For example, Arkansas had the highest obesity rate, but is middle-of-the-road when it comes to percent of the population without health care.
          While states like Hawaii and Washington DC have both very low obesity rates and are in the leader range when it comes to residents without health care.
        <br> <br> Note: that when this was published in 2021 Washington DC has still not recieved representation in the senate nor house despite having a larger population than some states. </p>
