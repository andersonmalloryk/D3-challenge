# D3-challenge
This is the 16th homework for the UMN Data Analytics and Visualization bootcamp. This homework visualizes state data for income, obesity, and percent with health care coverage. D3 is used to draw the graph and provide features such as switching from two data sets on the x-axis as well as allowing the user to see data for each state when they hover over it. Each dot also is labeled with the state's abbreviation.

## Design in CSS
Additional design for the graph was set using a CSS style file. This helped to set the color, font size, and shorten the code in the javascript file by referring to the CSS style file instead.

## Javascript
This graph is built using HTML and javascript and by calling upon D3. This allows great flexibility in how the graph is built and displayed. 

### Challenges
This challenge included a lot of small visual changes such as adjusting the outline color of the circles when they are selected to see the tiptool (the call out with information). In addition, it was very difficult to find a scale for the graph that fit all the dots in both visualizations (obese and healthcare) without pushing dots onto the axis or out of the visualization and reduce overlap of states.
